# Preface

Elizabeth Brereton Pratt Poindexter was the wife of Harry Kellar
Poindexter. She dies accidentally at the age of 27. She and her husband of
five years had a dispute one evening and they parted with his threatening
to divorce her. She walked away from her bedroom, went downstaris with
a pillow and a blanket. After turning on the motor of the family car,
which was parked in an enclosed garage off the basement, fell asleep, and died from
breathing in carbon monoxide.  Her husband finally realized the motor
was running and that she had not returned. He found her dead and then had to
face the next 15 years alone except for the four children that were left
to bring up. One of the remnants of those few years of married life was
a manuscript in Elizbeth's hand of a translation from the French of a
series of poems by Maguerite Burnat Provins called Le Livre Pour Toi.

E was an intelligent and educated woman, given to writing short stories and poety. So it seemed to be likely
that what turned out to be a translation was actually her own poetry. LLPT was erotic poety of the
early 20th c., first published in 1907. E's sister Sally had married against her father's wishes and had
gone with her geologist husband to Paris and was living there while he pursuded his career in Africa.
Sh was well red and knew of E's interest in 19th c french literature. No doubt, she sent the current literary
books and poetry to her sister living in KC with her young family. When E died her mother went through her
papers and found the ms of the translation of LLPT and not be herself being particularly well read thought
the translation was poetry written by E. and perhaps the cause of the dispute between E and her husband that resulted
in her death. Her mother took what she thought was an ori ms of here daughter's away from the other mss and gave it
for safekeeping to one of her nieces to keep. Like her aunt, Maude hazelton the niece that was given the ms,
thought the poetry was by E. It was after all, in her handwriting and the death was suggestive of an accidental
tragedy, and the name MBP could easily be a pen name. The ms was passed on to E's youngest Daugher, M E P when she
was 16 and was told by Mary's cousin, Maude Haz. that it had been written by E. Not completely believing this Mary
always check the name MBp in the catalogs of the U libraries where she went to school. It wasn't until 40 years
later that Mary discovered the MBP was a real person listed in the catlog of LOC and that LLPT had been
published in Paries in 1907 with many later editions, the latest in 2012.

It is stll being published but with no English translation. When Maary Poi consulted the UofC press about
publishing her mother's translation their response was that this kind of exotic poetry did not sell well in the US.
and that if you could get a press inerested in publishing that kind of poetry they would wan t a current and well
known translator to produce it, not an obscure unknown who had died in 1926.

Now I donot agree with that reasoning. In fact it seems to be that the cirucumsta of the ms having been recovered and its history
might make it of particuly interest tody.

Let us hope so. The work of transcribing and editing the translation were done by MPS e's younges daughet and RT, who is credited
with editing and the transcription.
