# Preface

Elizabeth Brereton Pratt Poindexter was the wife of Harry Kellar
Poindexter. She died accidentally at the age of 27. She and her husband of
five years had a dispute one evening and they parted with his threatening
to divorce her. She walked away from her bedroom, went downstairs with
a pillow and a blanket. After turning on the motor of the family car,
which was parked in an enclosed garage off the basement, she fell asleep,
and died from carbon monoxide poisoning.  Her husband finally realized
the motor was running and that she had not returned. He found her dead
and then had to face the next fifteen years alone except for the four
children that were left to bring up. One of the remnants of their few
years of married life was a manuscript in Elizbeth's hand of a translation
from the French of a series of poems by Maguerite Burnat Provins called
Le Livre Pour Toi.

Elizabeth was an intelligent and educated woman, given to writing
short stories and poety. So it seemed to be likely that what turned
out to be a translation was actually her own poetry. Le Livre Pour
Toi  was erotic poety of the early 20th century, first published in
1907. Elizabeth's sister Sally had married against her father's wishes
and had gone with her geologist husband to Paris and was living there
while he pursuded his career in Africa.  She was well read and knew
of Elizabeth's interest in 19th century French literature. No doubt
she sent the current literary books and poetry to her sister living
in Kansas City with her young family. When Elizabeth died her mother
went through her papers and found the manuscript of the translation
of Le Livre Pour Toi  and not being particularly well read thought the
translation was poetry written by Elizabeth and supposed it to be the
cause of the dispute between Elizabeth and her husband that resulted in
her death. Her mother took what she thought was an original manuscript of
her daughter's away from the other manuscripts and gave it for safekeeping
to one of her nieces to keep. Like her aunt, Maude Hazelton thought the
poetry was by Elizabeth. It was after all, in her handwriting and the
death was suggestive of an accidental tragedy, and the name Marguerite
Burnat Provins could easily be a pen name. The manuscript was passed on
to Elizabeth's youngest daugher, Mary Poindexter, when she was 16 and
was told by Mary's cousin, Maude Hazleton that it had been written by
Eliabeth. Not completely believing this Mary always checked the name
Marguerite Burnat Provins in the catalogs of the university libraries
where she went to school. It wasn't until 40 years later that Mary
discovered that Marguerite Burnat Provins was a real person listed in
the Library of Congress and that Le Livre Pour Toi had been published in
Paris in 1907 with many later editions, the latest in 2012. (check latest)

It is stll being in print but with no English translation. When Mary
Poindexter consulted the University of Chicago Press about publishing
her mother's translation their response was that this kind of exotic
poetry did not sell well in the United States and that if you could get
a press inerested in publishing that kind of poetry they would want a
current and well known translator to produce it, not an obscure unknown
who had died in 1926.

Now I don't agree with that reasoning. In fact it seems to be that the
cirucumstance of the manuscript having been recovered and its history
might make it of particuly interest today.

Let us hope so. The work of transcribing and editing the translation
were done by MPS e's younges daughet and RT, who is credited with editing
and the transcription.
