## Offering

Sylvius, it is for you that I write this book, for you alone.

You will not put it in the room where you work, nor on the bench in your garden; but you will keep it
in the hidden shelter of your sleep, the place where my enraptured head has made a burning hollow.

I offer it to you in memory of our hours of passion.

## I

I love you.

No one has taught me to say that. I have felt it come from the depths of my being, mount in my
blood to my lips, and fly thence to your youth and the fecund force that is in you.

It is with intoxication that I have heard it come from your lips.

It is a golden bird that rests on my eyes so lightly at first and then so heavily that my very soul reels.

And I come to rest in your arms, your strong arms where I feel fragile and protected.

The word which promises and which yields, the hallowed word born of our ardent life, hovers over
our head in a clear beam.  Sylvius, do you remember?

Then I have seen the Hour pass, the unique Hour that smiled on us and in its hands raised a white stone.

Slowly, one by one, down on its tunic the roses from its forehead dropped their petals.

Through my closed eyelids I have seen it pass; my cheek pressed against your heart that like a 
pendulum of rubies marks off the shining seconds.

## II

Because Love, with divine hands, has joined together our bodies as children tie daisies that they pull from
the field; because our lives have intermingled like the mingling of the singing waters, I consecrate to your 
youth an intoxicated hymn.

I will sing the emprise of your long hands that make about my waist a trembling girdle; I will sing your 
wilful look that annihilates my thought, your beating breast welded to my breast, and your legs, firm as the trunk of the maple tree,
about which mine twine like curly hop tendrils.

Like an idol, my adoration shall clothe your superb nudity with scented lilies and phlox picked in my garden.

I shall watch you sleep in their perfume.

Close against your appeased side, I shall listen to your blood flow 
in the mystery of your life, as in the evening I hear the brook which descends from the darkened forest.

Sylvius, when I shall be no more, when above my grave the seasons shall
bring blossoms to the hollyhocks and golden gilliflowers, in the purity
of the blue dawn their passionate voices shall sing again the song of
my love.

Then our souls will be but as one soul, and you will possess me for eternity.

^[Per Mary's e-mail of 2014-02-12: 
"My mother left out a whole stanza (paragraph?) that is in the
printed French version (1907 ed.) which may mean that she was
translating from a different edition which also left it out.  I
should do some research here if I can find other editions.  I know
Regenstein has some because I gave them to Regenstein.  So I will
check it.   Just for reference and maybe for use in a footnote, here
is what has not been translated.  It is the 2nd stanza:  'Je dirai la
lumiere de tes yeux, la volupte de ta bouche, la force de tes bras,
l'ardeur de tes reins puissants et la douceur tiede de ta peau,
blanche et doree  comme la clarte du soleil.'
Unfortunately this computer doesn't give me a way of adding the
accents to the French words.  Or if it does, I haven't discovered how
to do it."]

## III

I looked upon your body, standing simple and stately as a pillar of ivory, amber--colored like honey--comb.

I looked upon it, my hands crossed upon my knees; without touching it I gazed in fervent contemplation of its
splendor, and in my soul I loved it more passionately.

I feel myself almost afraid, dominated by that rhythm which sings to my senses a mysterious
music; I am silently exalted by this poem of virile grace, of haughty elegance, of triumphant youth.

O Sylvius, tell me that you give me all your beauty.  Tell me that it is mine --- that shining sun--kissed head; tell me that it is to me you
abandon your wide breast where I stretch myself to sleep, your firm narrow hips, your marble knees, your arms that could 
crush  me and your dear hands where my long kiss rests in the hollows of your caressing palms.

I looked upon your proud lips that yield under mine; your teeth, where my teeth strike against them, illuminate your smile; your warm tongue lulls me 
to sleep; and when I awaken from my giddiness it is to again look upon your triumphant body, stately as a pillar of ivory, amber--colored like honey--comb.

## IV

That night you took my head between your imperious fingers and you said, between your teeth, "Do not move!"

And I abandoned myself, my forehead circled by the ardent crown that of itself contracted.

Why did you not sink in your nails sooner? I would not have moved, and the pain, come from you, would have 
entered deliciously into my flesh.

Your young delirious desire might rend my muscles, bend my bones, make me moan with anguish; I am your thing, Sylvius; leave nothing of me, since 
my will has gone adrift into the alluring water of your eyes.

In that night, passive and nude, was I not a queen beneath the living crown of your tight--closed fingers?


## V

I am left pale from your caresses, pale to faintness in the mounting dawn, and I feel 
about my heart a ring of steel.

You have twisted my arms and dried up my lips; my ankles are bruised, my knees 
hurt, my loins are exhausted and my skin burns from your bite.

I will go bathe myself in the fountain where the red lilies grow, flaming like your kisses.

I will feel the water that has come from the glaciers refresh my broken members and 
give me the strength of the rocks, and then on the grass where now the sunflowers blossom, 
I shall sleep.

I know that the cat will come to share my slumber, her soft head on my bare shoulder.

And when the shadow of the walnut trees turns, discovering my forehead, then you will 
come to kneel beside me; I shall have forgotten my weariness and with your lips against 
my ear you will say to me, "Arise."


## VI

My eyes are ringed about with a warm shadow, red and blue, like that which sleeps at the bottom of the waters.

Your penetrating caresses have woven it about my vision where your image endures, encased in crystal; 
it floats lightly and voluptuously, a delicate veil over the vibrant memory of our embrace.

Sylvius, from what mystery was born this shadow between your arms?

There passes the phantom of your impassioned body, the sleeping vision of your bowed head, more 
beautiful in its abandon and leaving in my hands the feeling of soft silk.

There passes the slow gesture of your beloved fingers over my weary eyelids when you say to me, "Sleep, now."

Oh, come, and put your all--possessing lips (that utterly possess me) on the velvety orbit of this dear shadow.

It grows with the approaching evening, it ensnares you in its delicate web, and when you bend above my ecstatic 
face, where the black pools of my eyes grow darker, breathless you plunge therein your lucent pupils that enchant 
my night.

## VII

Sleep; my thoughts cradle you, my love watches over you, and the tranquil night slumbers at our threshold.

Rest your forehead on my bruised shoulder where your gentle breath passes like warm wind over the ripe wheat.

Sleep the profound slumber which parts your lips like those of a little child.  I will put sweet dreams into your heart, now quiet;
your heart that just now was galloping, fiery as a charging battle--steed blinded with blood, and that goes now more slowly
than the clock marking its little steps on the highway of Time.^[Here Brereton Pratt uses capital "T," Burnat--Provins a lowercase.  **m.s. p.8**]

Sleep; the beneficent moon has come to cover your extended body with a cloth of silver, and on your
repose her benign face shines divinely.

O Sylvius, flesh of my flesh, O my lover, may the night shed on your breast her sovereign refreshment, may she
with dew--drenched hands reanimate your vigour, while I, transported, delight in the serenity that has
descended on your beloved visage.

The owl cries in the walnut trees, but misfortune is far from us; the
melancholy of her solitary voice penetrates my heart without bitterness.

I fear nothing; you sleep, but you are near me.

I have put my hand on your motionless thigh and felt beneath my palm your entire being.  I barely 
touch you, your open fingers do not tremble, a supernatural calm comes over me from your beatitude; but I would
know, O Sylvius, --- when you sleep, do you love me?

I bend over you, your lips smile at my kiss, your arm curves closer about me.  Yes, you love me
when you sleep.

Then at last I lay my head close to yours, I share with you the celestial cloak that the moon
gives us.

I can sleep, Sylvius, until at dawn the cock shall crow.

## VIII

During the night when you were far from me, sleep and dreams sought vainly the way to
my couch, my eyes stayed open through all the dark night.

I heard the rustling of the leaves, the light steps of the cat on the beams of the house;
and I watched the slow coming of dawn.

Then the cock crew and the song of the bell rang from the tower that overlooks the valley.

The goats passed along the road; all things wakened; but joy remained asleep.

For day without you, O Sylvius, is it day?

## IX

The low branches of the hazel--bushes cast a light shadow on your joyous face.

Beneath my teeth you laugh, and your laugh makes me tremble to the tips of my toes; its youthful
insolence plays upon my nerves and sends a tingling into my half--opened mouth.

You laugh because I press my elbow on your chest with the air of a conqueror, so that
your two shoulders touch the earth.

You laugh because you know that your tightened hands could lift me without effort to throw me like a 
willow branch into the gray hay; because your arms make me a plaything to be rolled at your caprice
on the soft grass where the grasshoppers, green as jade, abide.

You laugh at my weakness, at my frail fingers, at my supple wrists that you make crack; and yet,
Sylvius, have I not triumphed?

Have I not seen your distracted head waver and fall again into my hair?

Then you did not laugh.

## X

The fruits that you give me are more delicious than any others, their aroma brings me something of you.

On your lips I have eaten them, sharing them with you with provocative kisses in the perfumed juice
of the purple plums.

You held my hands and our lips were fresher than the centers of the lustrous fruits; the hard
seeds hit against our teeth; your eyes laughed, but suddenly they darkened and you bit the ripe
raspberry at the point of my fevered breast.

If some day you must lacerate my heart, Sylvius, as you tear the fair fruits that summer showers
upon us, do not whet the blade that shines on the wall of your house, but take it just with your teeth,
tear it out, and let my blood pour forth more brilliant than the clear blood which swells the currants.

## XI

You said to me, and your voice trembled, "I would like to shut my eyes to everything else, and see 
nothing more but you."

Be blind, then, until death.

I will implant my features at the very bottom of your 
dear eyes, and you will shut them.

Then, O Sylvius, no longer will I be jealous of the flower, the tree, the cloud where your glance 
rests with delight.

You will not know that a woman passes by; that she has soft hair, 
white hands, a heart that could love you.

It is my image that will live, dwelling in the closed sanctuary of your thought, and the light from it will 
penetrate to the most secret part of your soul.

Bend nearer, Sylvius; nearer yet, that it may be as I have said.

## XII

Place your two hands on my two extended hands; I will sense the life in your fingers.

Plunge your eyes into my eyes, make there flow into me your look that burns and bathes me all 
at the same time.

Is it night, is it day?

Press your mouth very slowly on my mouth, that I may know nothing save that 
your breast crushes my breast, and that within my savage heart, your heart beats.


## XIII

O Sylvius, I have desired you in the wind that blows about me, in the rain that wets my forehead, 
in the returning ray of the sun.

I have demanded you of the earth where beat my empty arms, but your were not there.

I saw your smile in the flowers of the scarlet sage, your marvelous eyes in the little pond; 
I cried out to you and my soul burst from my breast in sobs.

For there was none of your pure breath in the air that touched my lips; the mountains 
separated us, your life was far from my life and only the feeble memory of your caresses 
touched my desolate body.

Do not go away any more Sylvius, leave me my heart, since it must stay with you.

## XIV

Sweeter to me is your voice than the sweetest of cantilenas.  It speaks within me; it filters into 
the utmost depths of my being, that adores you; it insinuates itself amongst my thoughts and arrests 
them, charmed.

Whence comes it, Sylvius; from your lips or from my love?

Speak to me: my eyes are closed to listen to you; happiness sings in your words, desire makes them palpitate 
like the call of the sighing doves; speak to me, my hands are trembling.

Say to me those ardent words that are the stars, and that only the night hearkens to, between us; 
say to me those words of twilight and of tenderness that make me thrill so that I would die if they were 
not life.

Bend down and speak, that the world may be swept away and about me prevail the wide heaven where, unique 
and harmonious, is raised your voice, sweeter than the sweetest of cantilenas.

## XV

During that unforgettable moment when we loved beyond the bounds of the earth and higher 
than heaven, in a shining world of our own, I knew all the elements of love.

A supernatural flame fused them in my heart as in a devouring crucible.

I was mother, sister, lover; I was your flesh, your blood, your mind, your soul transported, as it were, 
to the vast and glorious Beyond.^[Brereton Pratt uses capital "B" purposely.]


Your forehead leaned to mine; what was it that came from your life into mine in that flash of radiant 
purity?

Tell me, Sylvius, what puissant god lent us then a moment of his divinity?


## XVI

I combed my hair, tangled by the fever of your impatient hands; slowly the ivory teeth
unraveled it, strand by strand.

And my lifted arms dropped again from weariness, and the madness of the night stretched 
itself with the fine rebellious floss that curled up again.

Now I can neither pin it up nor plait it; it stays in an amorous wayward wave; 
of itself it deepens into restive and profound billows like savage seas; 
and, satiated with your delirium, longs for it yet again.

Come back, undo all of my labor; I abandon it.

And to--morrow, between long kisses, with your brown fingers you will tenderly smooth my brown curls.

## XVII

It was dark, intensely dark, and my open eyes were like closed eyes.

I heard your teeth grind like the branches of the elm in a hurricane.

Above my head was the lightning, and the gallop of mysterious madness surging through 
your arteries as if to burst them.

I felt that you forgot me, that you went further than I towards life.

And reverence for your power left me mute, holding back the sound ready
to break from my throat, holding back the words crowded between my teeth,
holding back the unchained spasm that I might hear the rush of yours in
the brief and triumphant out-cry gushing forth  from the joy of the flesh,
in the cry of victory thrown to eternal love.


## XVIII

Sylvius, your hands near my mouth are heady flowers that transport me, and I take your firm
fingers between my teeth like the branches of the elm trees that I broke off laughingly.

But you disdain this puerile sport that leaves no mark, and you shake your head.

Do you know that I would like to bite you to the heart, and to drink long of your life 
without ever lifting my head.

## XIX 

Let my fingers drag over your white skin like seaweed in the tide.

Let my fingernails trace on your loins of steel living hieroglyphics.

Let my mouth quench its thirst with the freshness of your reposing body.

Let my teeth hold your lips gently, without hurting them.

Let my cheek be wedded tenderly to your cheek.

Let my hands expand exactly over your hands.

Let ... ... ...

And then, Sylvius, I shall sleep.

## XX

To listen, and hear nothing.

To tremble, and not be cold.

To be afraid, with nothing to fear.

To await you, when you do not come.

## XXI

There is this morning in my breast a great shining happiness that mounts like a dazzled lark.

In my blood red roses bloom, so red and so filled with perfume.

I hear the fountains exult and the birds sing in answer to the fresh flowing waves in my veins, 
the joyous songs that ring in my ears.

To the rustling leaves, the swelling fruits, the wandering clouds, I would like to tell the secret 
words that would astonish them; I would like to kiss the warm stones and press them to my heart; 
I would like to have infinite kindliness and great wings to carry it to all the universe.  My eyes
drink in with ecstasy the radiance of this triumphant day; why?

Because you have come.

I feel that I must give back to nature the intoxicating joy that you have put in me.

## XXII

You said to me: "I would like to kneel and kiss the hem of your gown."

You said: "I know no more ... ."

And your voice would have made me shed divine tears.

It was at the time when as yet I was not yours, Sylvius, when I read your love only in your imploring
eyes; the time when your life was but a silent prayer to which I hearkened.

Come, now; here is my gown, here are my hands.

Kneel down, I will slowly caress your bent head.  Your soul will mount to me like incense, I will 
breathe it in entirely, I love you infinitely, and your words in their shining purity I will guard like 
diamonds.

Know well --- I too would have been bowed down.

On my knees before you I would have said --- "Give me those trembling hands that dare not touch me, I put in them 
my heart; accept the offering. ---

It is yours in joy and in sorrow, in life and ind death."

But then, Sylvius, the hour had not yet struck.

## XXIII

There is in your fair hair a stirring sweetness that draws me and attracts me always.

There is mist and there is gold, like dawn in the country of the plains; there is the melancholy of the 
withered things of autumn, the hour when the pale nasturtium leaves send their pungent odor into the garden.

Shining zones traverse it as, in the yellowing forest, we have seen the fresh wood 
gleaming from beneath new--peeled bark.

But in the glory of the day, paths of light flood to your temples that are adorned with the brightness of the sun; 
beaming rays wind there as on the trembling oats and whispering wheat.

And when I sleep, guarding you in my arms, my lips resting on that warm mysterious silk, the living silk of your hair, 
troubled thoughts pass in my slumber.

Beneath a portico of white marble, made ruddy by the burning summers of Greece, whilst die the violets on the blue 
flagstones, an amorous princess lets fall for me her tunic flowing in 
numerous folds, her light tunic, the color of saffron.

## XXIV

You asked me: "Why do you love me?"

It is a far--off voice that answers from the shores of my destiny.

I love you because once it was written in the Book of Life that our paths should meet, that my glance 
raised to you should penetrate your glance, and that thenceforward we should be but one.

I love you because it was written that my arms should 
receive the marvelous gift of your beauty and bear it, for some 
unknown number of days, toward the enchanted harbor of happiness.

I love you because there has been added to the eternal blossoming time 
an imperishable calyx, a gleaming corolla, born from our mingled spirits, our 
blended souls.

I love you because you are you.

## XXV

While you reposed on my arm, extended to support you, I felt against my side a superb marble.

With a strange emotion I followed its faultless line; I doubted your life, for despite the throbbing that revealed it, 
you were to my fascinated eyes a fair vision returned from the Golden Age, an heroic statue stretched out 
beside me, so noble in its absolute calm, so forceful, though quiet, so pure in its utter perfection.

Not that brush most skilled at fixing our mortal images, nor the genius--inspired chisel that makes the 
indifferent Parian marble come to life, could ever give me back the moment of superhuman beauty when, 
like a young god, you slumbered on my shoulder.

## XXVI

It is mid--day, Sylvius, and I have made ready our repast.

I have placed before you the bowl of steaming mush, the colorful fruits
and the fresh milk wherein you plunge your lips so thirstily, like a
little child.

About us, everything exults; dragon--flies glitter, bees dive to the heart of the heavy--hanging roses, the marigolds 
outstretch their golden targets and the fruitful branches of the apple trees are bowed down, oppressed with the warmth.

Your eyes shine, you are happy.  Your teeth bite with delight into the nectarines and the glossy pears, and I would be jealous 
of their torn flesh did I not know that very soon, with your whole soul, you would implant on my bare arm a long, long kiss.

## XXVII

I held your head beneath my affected gaze; it shone like a priceless gem.

I contemplated the soft gold of your hair, the limpid jewels of your eyes,
the shining whiteness of your teeth and the firm skin nurtured by the sun.

As the hand of a sovereign bears proudly the imperial orb, so I believed that my fingers were touching all 
the richness of the world.

Sylvius, are you not for me the most splendid of treasures?

## XXVIII

Down the open pathway of my years I have advanced proudly; but now I am halted.

My free steps followed only their fancy; but you have imprisoned my ankles in bonds of silk.

My watchful eyes questioned all of life; now I see naught but you.

My active fingers have become quiet in your fingers.

My mouth sings only the joy that you have given me.

And I shall remain your captive, like a fish caught in the meshes of a net, like a partridge which feels tenacious hands
closing in upon its freedom.

Henceforth may I ignore the road and the rest of the world.

May I forget the words that tell not my love the gestures that are not needful to enthrall you.

May my horizon end at your smile.

But I conjure you, O Sylvius, as the most humble of the things that have a place in 
your home --- take care of me.

## XXIX

After I have given you everything, there is yet in my heart 
a sadness for that which still separates us, a regret that your dear look, that I love so much,
must stop at my face without penetrating to my thoughts, so filled with you.

And I wish that, in taking my body, you might through my transparent breast behold my heart; then you 
would better comprehend the fervent adoration that mounts to you.

Alas, it is in vain that you would break open and search my breast; the unknown remains unknown, 
and it is not in this world that you may possess it.


## XXX

Long after sunset my house shows white in the dusk.  I am going to wander along the road 
where the slow hop--toads are making their way to the stubble--fields, among the thistles, with 
almost human movements.

I watch the trees grow black and the sky grow green, Venus shines there alone; I await you.

When, to come to me again, you climb up the slopes where the vines are ripening, and through 
the meadows where the young elms are growing tall, I know that you are more agile than 
the chamois.

My expectant body senses your approach, and your step, noisy in the night, awakens throughout 
my being a throbbing like another heart.

At my darkened threshold your shadow stands, your breath slips through my hair, your 
lips find my lips.

Then we forget the stars and the chirp of the cricket that alone is listening; the night 
is flaming and it is the re--illumined sun that enters with you into my house.

## XXXI

Your mouth, in the dusk propitious to voluptuousness, takes on a different curve from that 
which is given it by the light of day.

A tempting flower, it blooms above my eyes, delight making it glow and undulate like a red 
carnation in the breeze.

It is the spring, sparkling and fresh, at which I drink of life; I provoke it and I submit to it, 
tender or wilful, appeasing or cruel, with the moist caress of your tongue, the brief bite of your 
teeth.

It rests on my exalted face and my blood whirls in a dizzy eddy, it puts me to sleep and awakens me, 
it breathes in all my will, all my energy, and because my lips understand your lips, I lose myself in your kiss.


## XXXII

There is left in my room a delicate and wandering odor that follows me.

It is the evanescent soul of our caresses flitting along the walls like a butterfly  of the night, 
fashioned of mother--of--pearl and silver, which turns about and dies beneath the chandelier. 

I fear to pursue it, it emanates from your ardor and it is something of you who are gone away.

During the day, I have left the disarray of the night.

I have left the crushed pillows, the trailing sheets, the groove that your body hollowed out.

There, upon your spirit, I shall go and stretch myself.

At the window, the curtain beats like a wing, warm perfume comes and goes, like your promising 
hand on my hair, like your enchanting lips on my neck, like your love that sails its sumptuous 
galley into my palpitant heart.


## XXXIII

You said to me: "Come ... ."

Your firm hand grasped my hand, your look penetrated my breast, your hip pressed mine, and 
over my head played the falcon of your desire.

In your vigorous arms my body swayed like an alder branch, your rapid breathing dizzied me;
vaguely I heard your words.

"I must have you for a long time -- a long time."

And the room turned upside down in my eyes.

You said to me: "Come ... ."

## XXXIV

While the moon was rising heavy and sad in the stormy sky, I mused:

There are no words profound enough to express our love.

There are no songs sweet enough to tell its sadness.

There are no shouts loud enough to proclaim its joy.

I shall stand before you, my held upright, my hands quiet, my knees together.

And in silence I shall look at you.

## XXXV

Lo, Eros, here you stand before my door, all bold and sun--kissed.  Your eyes are shining and your smile 
defies me.  I am alone, why do you come to torment me?

Eros, you bend above the basin of the fountain where your golden curls reflect themselves.  Your breath 
has lightly touched the water I will drink, and I am alone, why do you follow me?

I have chased the insolent cock that enters my garden, I have chased the naughty wasp whose sting 
pricks the ripe fruit, and the dainty cat from the milk that spills on my ankles.


But you ... .

My hands are without force to push away your proffered hands, my heart leaps and you listen to it slyly.

When on the stones of the pathway you shall hear the quick footsteps of Sylvius, together we shall go to meet 
him.  Then you will entwine our fingers, you will put your kiss on our lips, and lying close between us in the 
sweet warmth, you will laugh all of the night.


## XXXVI

I plunged my arm into the icy river that comes from the eternal snows; 
the sky was beneath my fingers and the water laughed.

I heaped my fire--place with silvery wood taken in autumn from 
the forest, and in the murderous flame the wood sang.

I left the window open; with the vehement soul of the roses, the song of the nightingale entered.

And, the better to see again your beloved spirit, I closed my eyes.

I felt your mouth like a living thing, more refreshing than the water; your look, more luminous than the flame; 
your volant smile, your body more intoxicating than the perfume of the roses.

And I trembled in my solitude.

## XXXVII

Twilight reaches the altered declivities and they become gray.

Amid the withering vines where the suffocation of the day 
still lies heavy, you are bent to pluck the ripe clusters.

The voluptuous grapes put a warm caress in the hollows of your hands.  I was jealous of that caress.

The bitten berries shed clear tears between your lips.  I was jealous of that kiss.

Your said to me: "How beautiful the mountain is!"

I was jealous of that beauty.

For I want to be alone, unique, between your hands, on your lips and in your heart for all eternity.

## XXXVIII

At times when my adventurous feet grew weary, I have left the highway to rest among the rocks.

The bell--flowers that grow in the crevices waved above my head, and, my cheek against the stone 
yet warm from the heat of mid--day, I listened to the sob of a hidden spring.

This time it is at your side that the night has halted my weary steps; it is against your ardent 
breast that my head reposes, your breast, firm as a rock, from which I would never more detach myself.

Oh, tell me that I shall always, always find shelter there.

My arms are about your proud inclining neck, your tender eyes bloom above my eyes, and it is the deep 
well--spring of your heart that I hear singing.

## XXXIX

O Sylvius, let us bless the effervescent hours of summer that lay their regenerating hands on our 
abandoned bodies.

Let us bless the thrilling song of the swallow; we shall not hear it much longer.

Let us bless the purple twilight when the moon colors every rose--petal with silver and mingles her 
eternal freshness with our kisses.

Do you hear the wind whisper tender things to us in the night?  Do your hear the hedge that trembles 
with happiness, the pale grass that thrills?

Behold, it is Love passing in the puissant shadow of the walnut--trees.

Love me, love me before the dolorous autumn, under the diamond--studded sky.


## XL

Let my soul murmur about your soul like a bee about a perfumed calyx.

Let my love trickle into your heart like the innocent spring which, beyond the blue mint, 
lives in the sun.

Let my thought be a white dove poised on your thought.

And let your life close down over my life, like a crystal over an imprisoned 
drop of water that it will guard for thousands of years.

## XLI

Near to me a spider is spinning her web with mist--like thread, the colour of dreams, 
the colour of water.

That flexile lace in its glittering white wheel is a perfidious snare over which death is hovering.

The foolish fly fell into it.

Now she is dead.

Yourself, about my steps you have woven a great net of fine gold, the colour of summer days and flaming 
noons, a weft of love worked by your youth.

Intoxicated, I fell into it.

Now I am alive.

## XLII

Behold, in the opulent orchards, the trees which are bending under their numberless fruits.

Their laden branches trail in the happy langour; the apples stir like adolescent breasts; 
the pears are widening at their satin hips, precious vials full of life; the plums, in 
transparent gold, stretch their delicate skin to our eager desire.

These generous gifts of summer are but a temptation with their inciting perfume, their offered 
flesh, their shape which is fitted to the palms of our hands.

But how much more delectable are the fruits of love gathered on your mouth, how much more exquisite 
on your lips which soften under my kiss. 

## XLIII

On leaving you I went toward the slumberous lake that mirrors the ruin. 

A single star fell there 
like a pebble of light, and the mists of evening were floating about, veils of the dead who seek a vanished form.

All was sad and sweet and inspiring in the fast--ending evening.

O Sylvius, why must we be separated!

With the fog, your adieu hovered like a melancholy black bird, and the waves of your voice 
rippled across the pensive water makes one think of death.

For a long time I walked, the road was solitary, heedless and sorrowful I lost myself in the night.

I left my heart in your breast.

## XLIV

Dwell near me, Sylvius, do not go away.

Hold tighter my trembling fingers; put your lips, like a protecting seal, on my blue eyelids that 
make the night descend while it is yet day.

My life follows you when you forsake me, and a giddiness throbs in my temples.

I can walk fearless in the most profound darkness, unaffrighted I plunge my eyes into the whirlpool 
where the torrent dashes to death; but I will not lean toward the abyss of your absence, I feel madness 
moving there.

## XLV

O Sylvius, when your steps carry you far away from me along the mountain roads, is it the look of my 
eyes that you see start in the dusky fruits of the blackberry?

Is it my voice that sings in your ears, from across the twisted branches of the pines?

Is it my name that the water murmurs as it plays among the pebbles?

And when you walk smiling, tell me, Sylvius, is it at remembrance of me that you smile?

## XLVI

I suffered, my teeth were chattering, and great sobs mounted in a boiling surge from my burning breast.

Only the dusk heard them.

I bared my tear--wet forehead to the white kiss of the moon, but it brought no refreshment.

I held out my arms that seemed on fire to the midnight wind, the wind said: Your arms burn me.

Nothing can assuage my grief.

Do not ask me why.

My arms seemed on fire; I held them out to the wind of midnight;
the wind said Your arms burn me.^[Is this a replacement or a
repetition? **m.s. p.48**]

## XVII

You will not say to me: No.

Remember that I have kissed your lips, that from them may escape only words of tenderness.

You will not let anger rise in your eyes.

Remember that I have kissed your eye--lids, that your look may be a caress to me.

You will not raise a finger to threaten me.

Remember that I have kissed your hands, that they may recall only gestures of gentleness.

You will not go far away from me.

Remember that I have kissed your feet, that they may return, faithful, to my house.

You will close your heart to the love of other women.

Remember that I have kissed your heart through your breast, that it may be mine beyond the tomb.

## XLVIII

Now I can walk lightly, I have put all my life in the hands of my lover.

The roses have no more thorns, the roads no more stones, the sky no more 
clouds, the days no more heavy shadow.

Sing, sing, my life, in the hands of my lover.

I will await the spring, my lips on his lips.

All the summer I will sleep close to him beneath the trees.

On his mouth I will drink the juice of the fruits of autumn.

Within his ardent embrace I will laugh at winter.

Unroll, my life, in the hands of my lover.

But I shall not wait until our kisses fade.

I shall summon Death seated on the ruin.

I shall say: Take us both at the same time.

I shall laugh at death between his fervent arms.

Fall, fall, my life, in the hands of my lover.

## XLIX

The words that you have said to me are like twittering birds that fly
around my head.

Sometimes one of them, the most tender, returns to my mouth 
where your lips left it; I feel it there, light as a feather, 
troubling as a kiss; and slowly it descends into the bottom 
of my heart to nestle there.

## L

You are silent.

My hands are clasped beneath your shoulders, my eyes are deep in your eyes, 
my mouth devours your mouth, your body that I am pressing close scarcely 
trembles, and when your eyelids close, heavy with passion, you seem to sleep.

Then your tranquil beauty gives me a mad temptation.

Had I but the power to annihilate you, to stop your heart at the 
second when I feel it utterly my own, to make you slip slowly from 
life to death.

Sylvius, you are silent.

## LI

To be still, to look at you.

To feel your love within me like glowing steel, and not to cry out.

To make myself dizzy with contemplating your visage, yet not to waver.

To follow the long line of your hands, without touching them.

To behold your provoking body very near, very near, without going nearer.

To suffer a torturing happiness: to be still, to look at you.

## LII

Sylvius, the flowers that you looked upon are dying here, close to me.

The rain commences to fall, hesitatingly; the fountain drops under the whip of the wind, 
and the unhappy cat is crying behind the door.

Outdoors, a step that one scarcely hears on the first dry leaves: it is Autumn that is coming.

No more long twilights nor light dresses, no more songs heard through the lighted windows.

The night is thick, I know that I shall pass it alone.

My lamp shines, the room is warm, and my heart is cold as a stone.

## LIII

You descend into slumber as into a salubrious sea that bathes your out--stretched arms.

On an undulous wave your languid body floats in a blissful dream born of our caresses, 
and your mouth offers itself again to my kiss.

But I gaze upon you, I watch over you without touching you.

My bowed head makes a shadow on your face; under my eyes it is that you repose, 
magnificent and sanguine, and in silence so profound that I hear only your heart beat.

O Sylvius, you can sleep, for you have loved me.

You quit my fevered body to descend into slumber as into a beneficent sea that bathes your out--stretched arms.

## LIV

I lay in a meadow, yellowed by the torrid summer.  I saw there three
meadow--saffrons, some ants and some fallen pears.

The sun showed a white eye through a gray cloud, the crows were cawing, and the ruin was as mournful 
as a sepulchre.  I mused "All must be sad also in a heart that has no love."

Myself, I carry in my joyous heart a beauteous garden, all perfumed, that the summer cannot burn, 
the autumn cannot wither, the winter cannot freeze.

The shining star that gives life, there too in the look of my 
lover, sweeter than the sweet periwinkle: his mouth blooms there like the purple poppy and the 
radiance of his forehead diffuses joy among my flower--beds.

There have I plucked marvelous fruit that no treasure could pay for, nor for all the gold 
in the world would I exchange them.

So I mused, stretched out upon the misty grass, there at the foot of the ruin.

Then the rain fell.

Now tell me, Sylvius, is not that a pretty thought, and is not that thought true?

## LV

Between my lips I put a stem of gray absinthe, and I noted its bitterness.

The sun has taken flight, the day has a look of silver, from the valley there rises 
an infinite sadness.

O Sylvius, I am afraid, something is going.

They have cut the branches of the oaks, the mag--pies are fighting in the larch 
trees, and the passing wind sends a shiver through me.

The meadows are purple with the melancholy flowers of autumn, and I have gathered 
veronica from the edge of the dried--up brook.

O Sylvius, I am afraid, something is ending.

Is it in you, is it in me?  I do not know.

Come back; take me on your knees and rock me as in the far--off evenings you remember, 
with words that one says to very little children.

## LVI

I have soft cushions and silken robes; I could lie and dream all the day long, letting 
my fingers lie idle under the weight of their rings.

But what is that?

I want to press against the hollow of your shoulder, the sweet retreat of love where I 
hide my forehead.

About my body I want only the sling of your strong
supple arms that bend my sides.

On my hands, that are yours, I want no other ring save your teeth gently closing in 
play to mark on my skin a ring of coral. 

I will rest if you come close to me, if I can breathe the pure honey of your lips, 
the dear drowsy words that close my eyes.


## LVII

I know no sweeter song, no music more divine, than the words of love that 
come up from your heart.

I have heard the wind of the days and the wind of the nights, 
whose song or whose plaints transported me.  I have heard it 
sighing about the ruin, mad with joy in the 
forest in the ravishing hours of spring--time, and whispering tenderly 
to the new--budding branches.

But I know now that the wind could not say everything.

I have heard the melodious bells that rejoice and lament in turn 
with our joys and sorrows, the bells which beat with my heart 
and lift it on their out--spread pinions; and I have shed tears at 
hearing them.

But I know now that that the bells could not express everything.

I have heard the insensate flood of the reawakened spring, 
the savage surging current of the eternal torrents.  I have smiled 
at the song of the slender stream which under the spiraeas unrolls its 
silver chain; I have trembled before the rage  of the cruel waves 
which grind the rocks and spread destruction.

But today I know words that the water has no knowledge of.

And while your joined hands sustain my enraptured head, 
it is your adored mouth that says them slowly on my lips.

O Sylvius, there is no sweeter song, no music more divine, 
and I am faint almost to death at listening.


 
## LVIII

No more shall I say to you how much I love you, Sylvius, for I know 
no more.

I shall lay my cheek on the bark of the oak, the tree of power and 
pride, I shall say to it: Let your leaf fly to him and bear the arrogance of 
my love.

I shall go to the delicate trembling birch, the tree dreamy as a 
moon--beam, I shall say to it: Let your leaf fly to him who has all my love, 
to tell him its tenderness.

I shall go to the lotus--tree which is golden in the autumn, the tree whose 
precious fruit is more beautiful than jewels, I shall say to it: 
Let you leaf take flight, by it he will know the ardor of my love.

You will make a nosegay of these frail messengers and let them wither on 
your heart.


## LIX

I love those deep and passionate wrinkles which voluptuousness brings 
to your altered countenance, when your body lives within me and we two 
are become one.

They are two narrow ravines where sink the heavy shadows of love and 
death.

They are the signs of a mystery almost sorrowful, which the sharp claw 
of desire has graven there, and in its passing madness the supreme 
intoxication effaces them.

But beneath my desirous look the invisible hand returns to again mark your 
face, to plow the two furrows where my kisses lose themselves.

I love those deep and passionate wrinkles.

## LX

I know not whether you came or whether you went; have I dreamed?

That noise, was it the wind rattling the windows, the cat wanting in?

Who knocked?  A nut falling on the roof?

Was it your face bending over me, that shadow that entered, or was it 
an amorous phantom, come from the night to betray my solitude?

Have I dreamed?

The sorrowful birds of darkness cried yesterday at even--tide, I heard them. 
But this other cry, at my shoulder, this maddening embrace that laughs at 
sleep ...

I know not whether you came or whether you went; have I dreamed?




## LXI

Oh! to be in your hands like a very little thing that you would 
carry with you always.

To be the water that you drink, the flower whose perfume you breathe in, 
the air that bathes your forehead.

No more to rule myself in body or in soul, to forget even that I live the 
better to sense your life singing within me.

My heart burns at your feet like an incense of Asia; could I but be 
lighter than smoke, more subtle than perfume, so to envelop you completely.

Sylvius, what will you do throughout the days with this burning being 
who abandons to you her weakness?

She can live at a smile, die at a word; Sylvius, what will you do with her?

## LXII

I give grace to Life, O Sylvius, for her liberality.

She has reached out to me a golden cup filled with the wine of your 
love, and I drink it to intoxication.

She has strewed beneath my steps the roses of your youth, my path is 
more beautiful than the triumphal way where conquerors advance.

On my couch she has thrown your body, modeled by a divine hand, and 
my humble cottage has become a palace.

One sees no throne there, with steps of emerald, shaded by the incomparable 
tree where sing birds of sapphire, where hang pomegranates of ruby; my roof 
is not covered with silver.

But it conceals more treasures than were ever possessed by a morose emperor.

O Sylvius, I give grace to Life for her liberality.




## LXIII

I want to look into you as into a clear stream that has never had a secret.

Put yourself at my feet, your arms on my knees and your eyes deep in mine.

Then tell me all your life; on your sincere lips I shall behold it.

Together we shall kill the gnawing jealousy that never sleeps, and I 
shall cast forth the remains as of a stray dog that would bite me 
to the heart.


## LXIV

You said to me: "I am not worthy."  And you bowed your head.

My kiss reconquered it, it glided over your soft golden temple where 
enchantments slumber.

What do you know of yourself?  Nothing.

You do not know the charm and freshness that play about your beauty.

You do not know your laugh like that of a fountain.

Your have not seen the shining halo that encircles your head in the hours that
I would wish immortal, so much rapture do they give me.

Your have not seen your eyes where all of heaven is kindled or dies away at the 
will of my caresses.

You do not hear the words that melt my soul and bear me towards the world beyond.

You know nothing. Hush.

## LXV
 
Across the gray earth of the fields, over the green fleece of the meadows, 
we have run together, holding each other by the hand.

The wind closed our eyes.

I longed to know how to fly, like the errant starling, I longed to be lighter 
than the fallen leaf of the reddening pear--tree, than the the winged seed of the thistle; to fly up with 
you to the white castles in the clouds and never more return.

## LXVI

Listen, I have looked upon the death of the white bell--flowers that I loved 
so much, and I have been thinking.

Despite the desperate love that has prostrated you at my door--step, 
despite my hands held out to lift you up, my arms hugging the emotion 
of your breast, and the dawn that finds us yet again in a close embrace, 
I have given you nothing of myself.

I have lost the hours and the minutes, I have lost the enchanted seconds; 
they are engulfed in the past.

Nothing will give back to me that which is no more, those luminous 
flowers of the hours, dead like the white bell--flowers that I loved so much.

What is there yet to look forward to?

Listen, if there comes to you a weariness of the embrace which 
is consummated before infinite love.

If you feel the words extinguished, the gestures useless in your over--heavy body, do not 
anticipate.

I will give you back my wrist, where is graven the sweetness of your mouth, and you will take 
my girdle to bind it to yours.

Then on the empurpled bed where stretches, magnificently exhausted, our mortal youth, like a 
summer evening in the blood--red splendor of the setting sun, together, O Sylvius, we shall sleep.

## LXVII

We walked in the grass already cold at twilight; the moon looked down upon us.

An immense veil unfolded itself over the valley, and the mountain--tops 
seemed to reach higher and clearer as if to share the mystery of the stars.

There was in the silence a great peace.

Your face was grave and tender and distant in the silvery shadow.

We two were quiet.

## LXVIII

I have left my beloved home on the hillside; it slumbers now forsaken.

The unquiet cat has found another lodging, and I have taken the road 
which winds among the rocks to descend into the valley.

The gold of the fecund apple--trees fell there where red apples laughed 
in the happy time; there fell too the gold of the bursting poplars whose 
leaves are trembling disks, but theirs was a tarnished gold without the 
shining aid of sun.

O Sylvius, what sadness in this unhappy day!  Beneath the melancholy 
effacement of the fog all life disappears, and on the deserted road, 
bordered with trees, I heard upon the ground, stealthy and light, a dead 
leaf that followed me.

## LXIX

Ere I left for other lands, I walked along the untamed river that 
boats fear to brave, and I beheld your peaceful roof, and the stone steps, 
and the ghost of the dead summer seated, her eyes closed, against the closed 
gate of your garden.

Impuissant, my arms could not reanimate that shadow or warm her on my heart 
to give new birth to the days that are gone.

Sylvius, so long as the black--trunked cornel--tree shall stand, our souls will live 
in that leafy shadow where we loved; they will blossom with the roses and bend down 
over the thick borders of boxwood.

The wind that heard our words will make them sing again along the sunny 
roads; the currants that my lips took from your hand will ripen joyously beside 
the hazel bushes, and the pale apricots with their silvery down will grow rosier each day.

Birds' nests will be there again, and the confident birds whose love will never be 
troubled.

But we, Sylvius, where will we be?

## LXX

Now a great distance separated us and it is the rapid river that companions me.

At day--break it looks like a silver mirror tarnished by the breeze, the heat of 
noon makes it radiant, and when the sun goes down it seems clothed in mother--of--pearl 
like the shells in which the sea still sings.

Dusk comes, and along the shore the sudden lights plunge there in their golden 
wands, while the somnolent islands are like great shaggy beasts, immobile on the water. 

And throughout the hours I admire it, the diverse and magnificent 
river; but this unknowing stream that passes so near your house tells me nothing of you. 
When you cross that distant bridge that trembles, it does not hear you, when you look at 
it, the river does not see you.

Is it thus, O Sylvius, that one day my memory shall slip from your wearied heart?

Or rather, like the faithful stone penetrated and made eloquent by the chisel, shall 
you award its imprint forever?


## LXXI

In this strange city, before the temple of Livy and Augustus, I have 
prayed for you.

The sanctuary is silent, but the gods are not absent from it; may 
they be favorable to my supplications.

Mossy blocks of stone are strewn over the ground there, and broken 
columns lie stretched out like corpses; doves perch on the tiles of 
the copings and the broken edges of the cornices; an angle shows the 
crescent of the moon watching from the sky.

O Sylvius, silent and solitary I adored you amongst these ruins haunted by two 
illustrious phantoms.

Before the temple of Augusts and Livy, I prayed for you.

## LXXII

I must tell you, Sylvius, whereto I turned my steps this twenty--third day of November.

It was toward an ancient domain whence all activity is withdrawn, where silence has 
established her tranquil reign.

On a vast terrace overlooking the surging sea, heavy oranges hang between 
glaucous leaves.

No one will gather them; they fall to the ground like those that you picked one 
evening on the enchanted island where blue peacocks adorn the wide stone steps.

Ah, how sweet was that other evening!

Can you not see again the rose--coloured palace, the tall reeds with their narrow 
pale silk leaves, and the white cock, like a bird carved of ivory among the 
blood--red trunks of the camphor trees.

Can anything revive the divine strophes 
of that dead poem?  Shall we ever return to the lake made murmurous by 
your oar?  No more can our hands be clasped, and my lips have not known yours 
for so long a time ...

But the ever--present thought of you followed me through the garden where
chrysanthemums were blooming under the gray vault of the plantains with their milky 
wounds that seemed to suffer.

Not far from there sleep buried treasures.

A man said to me: Yesterday I found a gold necklace.

And I saw a firm neck with its rounded nape --- Lavinia, or Fulvia --- who knows? 
The dust does not give up its secrets.

The man held out to me a tray full of those cut enamels that are used in making 
the patiently--assembled mosaics; I plunged therein my fingers, but beside my hand 
he laid on the multicolored cubes a severed hand of marble, white--smooth and cold; 
I caressed it and the marble returned my caress.

Fulvia ... or Lavinia ... Who knows?

## LXXIII

I sat down in the desolate semicircle and plucked there a pomegranate, that the careless 
summer had not ripened.

Just now, the wind alone roves through the Porta Ruggia, and on the steps that once 
sustained the courtesans of Augustus, only the sun sets golden feet and slowly descends.

On this autumnal morning one hears only a melancholy rustling; the almond and fig trees 
are dropping their leaves on the very place where fell the perfumed rain on the 
porphyry and carved stones of Africa.

Slim and immaculate as the chaste body of a wavy--haired Vestal, the one column, that 
remains upright hurls at time the defiance of its persistent
youth; but the masks are dust, the voices are stilled, the life, once vibrant under the purple 
wing of the velarium, has disappeared.

Birds of the night find lodging in the niches where strong hands enshrined precious bronzes, 
and solitude mourns under the high arches of the sundered arena.

O Sylvius, if only you were near me to give solace to my soul in the presence of the 
enormous and mysterious wall of masonry that eighteen centuries have respected.

I looked ... I looked long to penetrate the shadows; I listened for an echo of old 
songs; but I perceived nothing near me but your image, proud and tall, standing 
on the shattered flag--stones; I heard nothing but the longed--for sound of your voice.


## LXXIV

I climbed the hill that overlooks the city with its flat roofs and golden walls 
like a fried honey--cake.

Up there I ate shiny black olives and bread that looks like a figure made of pottery 
with arms that reach out.

But I did not find there, as in the days when you shared my repast, the curving 
mark of your teeth that made the bite of bread as sweet to my mouth as a kiss, and it was 
with an aching heart that I once more took the path strewn with purple pebbles.  
They are perfumed with mint and thyme, and the mistral, come from the north, begins 
to blow over the valley.

## LXXV

Near the house where I was staying, the other night two lovers in full youth 
killed themselves.

Together they emptied the cup and asked the poison, the liberator, to end 
their sufferings.

I looked at the closed windows of that chamber of death and I thought:

I, too --- I would rather see you dead than belonging to another; I would rather 
see your brow calm in eternal sleep than shining with happiness stolen from me.


## LXXVI

I hear the blacksmith's hammer ringing on the anvil, I see birds in their reed cages, 
copper kettles hanging in the kitchens near the onions so handsomely reflected, and green 
jars on the ground beside brimming pitchers.

These humble things recall to me the unknown, as yet, home that I wish one day to share 
with you --- where I may give you the work of my hands, all the love of my heart, 
all the vigour of my life.

## LXXVII

O silver earth, where grows the ancient olive--tree!

O golden earth, beloved of the sun, you are made for love!

Let Sylvius some day put his hand in mine, and I will bring him here to your 
noble cypress--trees.

Then like the bold--eyed Apollo I shall behold him nude in the glowing light that 
makes you resplendent.

And while the locust sings, together we shall lie on your warm breast that is 
ever moved by beauty.

## LXXVIII

The river, this evening, is red from the menace of the wind.

Long darts of fire traverse it and the moon mirrors there her clear shield.

The sun, in superb agony, sets the towers afire, leaves whirl about like flames, 
and I pass along --- eyes closed, hair tossed, dress blown about my ankles --- 
to the city where stands the ruined castle above the black colonnades of cypress trees.

Is it not thus, O Sylvius, that we walk through life towards death.

## LXXIX

To love you even as the breath of the mistral.

To seize upon you, astounded, as it seizes the plantain leaf to toss it about at its whim; 
to make you shut your eyes and hold out your arms; to see you stagger, and to throw you down 
in order to pick you up again, imprison your hands in mine, and lull to rest your 
distracted heart.

To love you even as the breath of the mistral, to drive you mad.

## LXXX

In the measure that the banks of the river widen out and I descend to the sea, 
I feel fall from my shoulders the cloak of tenderness with which your love enveloped me.

Where are your arms, Sylvius, where is your mouth that devoured my heart, where your embrace 
that sent flames coursing through my veins?

Those hours of passion lie in the past like the dingy bark of a dead tree.

What triumphant springtime will come to resuscitate these dead things that I mourn, 
and what day in the dim future will make shine on my path the light of your eyes?


## LXXXI

A gerfalcon soars, the mountain is abrupt and broken.

On the sides of its highest rocks the ocean that once covered it with salty waves has left the 
star--shaped prints of shells, as the footprints of birds are marked along sandy shores.

It is there that I saw the last vestiges of the dungeon of the fair princess whose hair today 
reposes in a glass coffer.

During the long hours of the days and the night the perseverance of the wind has wrought in those 
condemned stones the semblance of a rare lace, and unquiet spirits ascend the invisible steps 
where her delicate feet adventured.

Where is she now, Sylvius, this damsel of other days who must sleep forever?  An ethereal 
ash dispersed over the valley, a breath in the freshness of the morning, a perfume added to the 
the perfume of the lavender when the glorious rushes of springtime blossom.

And behold here her unique legacy: with the fragile box this silky hair tangled like the floss of the 
smooth--fingered embroiderers who sing as they work.

## LXXXII

The arenas are empty and white in the sunlight, and I am confronted by their gaping circles, under 
the blue flax of the sky.

But silence has not been able to impose itself entirely within these tragic precincts; 
the centuries have not brought oblivion.

O Sylvius, always and eternally there are groans from the depths of the dungeons, roars in the 
open cages from which savage death comes bounding; there are the shrieks of tortured humanity in the air which eats 
away the crumbling marble; and the earth, still intoxicated with the blood it has drunk, thrills me with the pangs of 
so much agony.

Sylvius, Sylvius --- that I cannot take refuge in your breast!  I am not alone in the presence of the abandoned 
circus --- they are there, the cruel and magnificent spectators, they make their frenzy live again in me.

Ave Caesar ...

From your heart I beheld the trickle of a thin red stream, I saw your long immobile hands on the sand of the arena 
thronged with so many terrific combats.

## LXXXIII

Sylvius, I love you more than ever, and I go on --- alone.

The river has abandoned me; its waters that passed under your eyes, go on and are lost, 
I have bade them adieu.

Here is a road across the smooth sand; the ships at anchor in the blue canal swing 
about with plaintive groans that ask again for the surging billows, the wide horizon.

About the gray plain soar the seagulls; the wind tunes her harps through the tamarind trees; 
sharp perfumes define themselves beneath the rays of the sun; and now at last we are at the sea.

The untiring sea that ceaselessly tears down and builds anew the moving architecture of the 
waves --- frieze of foam, cornice of jade, steps of marble, which sink to the depths only 
to rise again.

On the stones, at the feet of the fishermen, are heaped purple fish with staring eyes, capelans, 
devil--fish, flat--fish painted with living colors, mullets from the lakes and flying fish from 
the sea.

The brown nets, dyed with rusque from Africa, are drying on the piers, and the men 
squatting before them sing as they mend the broken meshes.

Spectral lighthouses stand along the shores.

In the sky there are violet--hued mountains, great copper--colored porpoises, and blood--red 
birds.

## LXXXIV

Before my window grows a many--branched prick--wood tree, gay with its red fruit.

The light of a beautiful day falling on the curved tiles caresses a cat that is striped 
like a jungle tiger and on a white cat that lies there, prouder than any queen and 
infinitely disdainful.

I hear despairing cries, imploring phrases, voluptuous murmurings.

Truly, Sylvius, is it not there, beneath my window, before the green tree with its shining 
fruits, in the good warmth of the roof --- the desire that supplicates and that demands, 
the love that threatens and that prays, the thing through which the world is the world, 
the delirious invocation!

## LXXXV

I have traversed this plain which is at the same time arid and fertile where the mistral sways the willows 
and the mulberry trees, but now the hour has come to leave it.

I have seen the cities with their stone ramparts and the thatched huts on the inland island where wild 
horses run at liberty.

I have seen, at evening, the level farms gradually overcome by silence and under the moon 
it was a landscape of silver that slumbered.

I have seen golden windows where shone a friendly light and I have passed by.

Though my steps be weary, it matters not --- I must go on.

But as the all--powerful masters of empire were wont to voyage with their wealth, I have 
borne with me the image I adore, and despite the fatigue of the way, my hands guard the 
precious burden.

When I stop at a crossroads, it stands forth ever more beautiful on the white altar 
of memory, and at its feet I piously heap the rustic flowers and humble sprays that I 
gather along the road, that they may there wither and die.


## LXXXVI

Walking along the top of the thick walls that surround the city, from the 
terrace where the white henbane grows I see the peaceful asses lying on their warm straw, 
the scattered herds that range the pastures, and the fiery ovens where the herdsmen make 
ready their evening repast.

There, laid out on planks, are tomatoes, golden--crusted bread, chaplets of garlic --- and hung 
over the doors, garlands of little birds brought by the hunters after sun--down.

An appetizing odor mounts to me towards the empty towers where silent memory broods.

Sea--gulls wheel about screaming over the lagoons; a bell rings; among the smoking 
chimneys rises a solitary cypress tree.

What day, O Sylvius, shall I hear at this hour of rest your step on the road, your laugh 
at my threshold?

What night shall I find again, long pressed against my lips, the fresh sweetness of 
your kiss?

## LXXXVII

Imagine me stretched out on the sandy beach, my palms flat on the sand that I caress 
like a soft silky fur.

That I might come to this legendary shore and listen to the music of the waves in the 
shadow of the tamarinds and the blue thickets, I traversed the fever--ridden island 
where goats graze the coarse clumps of grass, and the handsome--horned cattle, sunk 
to the haunches in the marsh, stretch their slavering noses toward the flat solitude.

The herons with their steely wings and curving--necked 
flamingoes range the foothills; pheasants run on the green--gold sand, and the horizon 
is only a brown line scarce broken by the black top of a parasol pine tree.

O Sylvius, what do the proud waves say as they break close to me?

The say -- "Look, and let your fancy wander."

Your love is stronger than salt, vaster than the horizon, deeper than the sea.


## LXXXVIII

In the twilight the cattle are coming along, driven by their white--robed guardians.

The road is clear and there are more than a hundred of them.

The yellow metal surface of the water shivers and breaks as the great beasts plunge
into the pool.

Thorn bushes bend beneath their heavy hoofs, and silvery horses, like moon--beams, 
cut through the dusky herd.

Sylvius, it is as if near me danger is passing.  But I fear nothing except to lose 
your love.

In this twilight I hear the trample of the cattle going further and further 
away, and from a distance I long watch the herdsmen on their nervous white horses.

The craters of the sky throw forth red lava, the setting sun gives a sinister light to the 
plain, and very soon I shall not be able to see to return down there, to the city of 
dead waters.

Into the heart of the solemn night the black cattle have disappeared.

## LXXXIX

The autumn wears away like a sorrowful woman who has lost all that she loves.

I have seen the funeral procession of last leaves on the dull road, and winter 
has put cold hands on my cheeks.

O long road, O solitude --- empty of evenings!

Sylvius, absence is not good, it stirs up dormant passions.

Do you know what I see in the morning?  Your smile, that no more comes near me.

Do you know what I see at mid--day?  Your kisses, pressed to other lips.

Do you know what I see at night?  Your embrace about another body.

And my long days are clouded by these melancholy visions...

O Sylvius, give me back the sun!

## XC

When I shall have removed my dusty traveling dress, I shall stand before you.

I shall rest in your hands my breasts swollen with desire; they shall 
threaten you with their two brown points.

I shall offer you my body like a polished table where appears, unique and 
sweeter than the unctuous fig, the fruit half open to the heart, which has 
power to nourish and refresh you.

I will take your knees between my knees, on your teeth I will press my tongue, 
and into your eyes -- to the very bottom of your eyes --- I will look ... and look ...

## XCI

I have traveled over other roads and passed along the angry river divided by the rocks.

I have seen oxen subdued under the yoke and the peasant who touches them with his long 
whip, with the magician's gesture learned from his father and grandfather.

I have seen the patient little donkeys bending their heads down to their dainty feet.

I have seen snowy white geese shine at dusk along the edges of pools.

But for men I have not turned my eyes.

For it is you who gave me to drink one summer day when the air was stifling.

It is you who with sorrowful eyes watched me depart from the valley darkened by the storm.

It is you who loved me without limit under the sky where lived millions of stars.

Who then shall I look at now?


## XCII

What is there at the end of these desolate moors at the close of day?

The last ray of the setting sun as straight as a golden blade.

What is there on the branches of the oak when dusk throws her powdery dust over 
the fen?

Black birds that are going to sleep.

What is there round about the cottages with their curving roofs in the gray silence of the mist?

Shepherds high on their stilts, great herds that one does not hear.

And in my heart, so heavy with your absence, what is there?

You --- my dear love --- always you ---

## XCIII

What say the sirens at the end of the harbor --- not those that sing, but those that moan?

They say that ships shall go out to sea, out in the salty spray, out to the vast space 
where mysteries lie sleeping.

Out there, they see only the immensities forbidden to the feet of man; the sky and the water.

They tell what was revealed to them through nights of tempest, what the 
surging waves hurl to the unknown --- but who understands?

And I, Sylvius --- I say what comes forth from the deep torment of my soul.  But who 
understands?


## XCIV

Where are you when my teeth are clenched, my cheeks aflame, my temples throbbing as if they 
would burst?

Where are you when my hands in revolt search for you and find but empty space?

Where are you when my own bare arm against my face makes my blood race with 
insatiable desire?

And when remembrance of you consumes me and devours me like its prey --- Sylvius, where are you?


## XCV

Why is there sunshine to--day upon the green water, the path where I walk, the basilica whose seven spires, 
piercing the heavens, are like new wax candles ready to be lighted?

Why is there sunshine in the streets that are so narrow my extended hands can touch the walls on 
either side?

I have smiled at strange women, I have listened to the song of the caged nightingale, I have 
breathed in the good smell of parsley being cut up, and I have watched the neddy carrots grow 
shining clean under the fountains.

Everything was alive, Sylvius, and I loved all life.

And I know why the sun was shining on all things and within my heart; 
because I shall see you again.

## XCVI

In a corner of the square, a tulip tree grows up against a high wall that bristles with iron points.

Just like sea--monsters whose spines are so armed with terrible defense.

On the stones I read this word --- Inutile.

Our separation, O Sylvius, is it not the inflexible wall concealing the garden?

But on the day when we meet again, a gate will open, the enclosure will know 
new life and the tulip tree will blossom, even in the heart of the coldest winter.

## XCVII

I am hungry.

What has become of the great golden fruit that appeased my desire?

I am thirsty.

When will there be returned to me the living cup of your lips, the cup whose 
rim is enriched by your blood, where I drank deep of your soul, sweet as pure water?

I am cold and it is night ... my life, where are you?

What hour will give me your warm body, and the clear fire of your heart where I may warm 
my hands at the flame?

Where are the lamps that are your eyes, the pearly lamps like a moon hung over our summer of love?

All that is far --- so far away.

And the wind is blowing and it is winter.

## XCVIII

Night.

A city unknown to me, a noise of falling water, the step of a stranger that goes on --- where?

Weather that weeps in my heart and takes it --- where?

## XCIX

My deserted house is numb with the cold.

Shadow and frost dwell in the room where, last autumn, purple flowers overflowed from the vase you gave me.

Like skeleton fingers the walnut branches touch the window no longer open, the pathway is effaced, the 
cat perhaps is dead.

But our love survives like a bright snow--drop; eternal and everlasting, it smiles when all is desolate.

## C

Sylvius, where you draw breath there is no more winter, your fair head is a very springtime.

During my long voyage my eyes were fixed on you as on a star that marks the way, and here I am.

I see the valley that leads to your house, I feel your lips in the wind.

It is very near the day when your brow shall lean to mine, when you shall say in the low tender 
intoxicating voice that makes my very soul tremble: you are there ---
