This is an English translation of the French prose poem "Livre Pour Toi."
The original poem is by Marguerite Burnat-Provins. This translation is
by Elizabeth Brereton-Pratt.

This repository contains markdown source files of the translation, which
I transcribed from one of Brereton-Pratt's manuscripts. There is also
a forward, as dictated to me during a phone call with Mary Silverstein,
Brereton-Pratt's granddaughter. There are also templates for producing
latex and html output using [pandoc][]. A makefile has commands for
producing final pdf and html. I have plans to produce epub as well.
